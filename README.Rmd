# Introduction and aim

I don't have color vision deficiency (CVD, commonly called colour blindness), but I have a persistent interest in choosing CVD-safe colours that comes from my work as a scientist (because we show data in graphs) and as a person who teaches R sometimes (because syntax highlighters show code elements in colour). To support the latter, I made [a colourblind-friendly theme called Pebble-Safe for RStudio](https://github.com/DesiQuintans/Pebble-safe) and I am continuing to [make it easier for people to make their own themes](https://github.com/DesiQuintans/RStudioThemeTemplate) to suit their needs.

In making the Pebble-Safe theme, I documented a method of selecting CVD-safe colours that amounted to _"Shuffle them in a grid and if two colours look similar beside each other, delete one of them."_ This is fine and even necessary as a final step, but it definitely shouldn't be the _first_ step since it's so effortful.  

This time I'm going to use similarity and network analysis methods to pre-select distant colours.


## Packages used

```{r packages_used}
# remotes::install_github("DesiQuintans/librarian")
librarian::shelf(tidyverse, gt,
                 DesiQuintans/desiderata,  # Has the data for this analysis
                 qgraph, igraph,
                 spacesXYZ, khroma)  # CVD colour conversion and comparison
```

# Dataset

I'll be using a dataset from my personal package, which contains Google's Material Design 2014 colour palette together with simulated CVD conversions of those colours that I generated using `khroma:::anomalize()` (a private function inside that package).

```{r}
show_colours(material2014_colblind$normal, n = 14)
show_colours(material2014_colblind$deutan, n = 14)
show_colours(material2014_colblind$protan, n = 14)
show_colours(material2014_colblind$tritan, n = 14)
show_colours(material2014_colblind$achrom, n = 14)

mat2014 <- 
    material2014_colblind %>%   # Shorter name
    filter(not.na(name) == TRUE)

glimpse(mat2014)
```


# Choosing distant colours based on their colour difference

`khroma::compare()` lets me calculate colour distances using the CIELAB [distance metric recommended in 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000), which is a wild thing to behold.

```{r}
#' Produce a pairwise distance matrix of colours 
#'
#' @param vec (Character) A vector of colours.
#' @param colour_names (Character) Human-readable names of those colours.
#'
#' @return A distance matrix.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' colour_distance(c("#FFFFFF", "#FF0000", "#0000FF"), c("white", "red", "blue"))
colour_distance <- function(vec, colour_names) {
    col_dist <- 
        vec %>% 
        khroma::compare(metric = 2000) %>%   
        as.matrix()
    
    rownames(col_dist) <- colour_names
    colnames(col_dist) <- colour_names
    
    col_dist
}

colour_distance(mat2014$normal[1:4], mat2014$name[1:4])
```

I can use these pairwise distances to find which colours are least similar, and therefore good candidates for high-difference pairings like syntax highlighting.

```{r}
#' From a colour distance matrix, which colour is most distant?
#'
#' @param mat (Dist) A distance matrix.
#' @param colour_names (Character) Human-readable colour names that will be
#'      used to label the rows and columns of `mat`.
#'
#' @return A character vector.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' c_mat <- colour_distance(c("#FFFFFF", "#FF0000", "#0000FF"), c("white", "red", "blue"))
#' furthest_colour(c_mat)
furthest_colour <- function(mat) {
    colour_names <- rownames(mat)
    
    data.frame(name = colour_names,
               furthest = colour_names[max.col(mat, ties.method = "first")])
}

x <- colour_distance(mat2014$normal[12:16], mat2014$name[12:16])

furthest_colour(x)
```

## Does it work?

Not really, because it seems to pick the same distant colours repeatedly.

```{r}
dist_normal <- colour_distance(mat2014$normal, mat2014$name)

furthest_normal <- furthest_colour(dist_normal)

sample_n(furthest_normal, 10)

count_unique(furthest_normal$furthest) %>% arrange(desc(count))
```



# Choosing distant colours by graphing

If we want to get the most out of actually _choosing_ colours, then we're going to have to _look at_ them at some point. As I said in the introduction, my past work involved a lot of shuffling colour swatches and comparing them side-by-side. Now that I have computed colour distances, maybe I can make a graph that does most of that work?

```{r}
similarity_graph <- function(vec, threshold = 0, file = NULL, 
                             width = 3000, height = 3000, title) {
    mat_dist <- colour_distance(vec, 1:length(vec))
    
    # mat from colour_distance() is a pairwise difference/distance matrix.
    # However, qgraph uses weights as measures of closeness (similarity),
    # not distance. So we need to convert from distance to similarity.
    # https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/158285
    
    colour_similarity <- 1 / (1 + mat_dist)
    
    # I may want to remove a lot of weaker edges to make the major correlations
    # more visible.
    similarity_threshold <- quantile(mat_dist, threshold)
    
    my_graph <- 
        qgraph(colour_similarity, layout = "spring",
               shape = "square", vsize = 2, color = vec,
               # Labelled with the row number of the colour in df.
               label.scale = TRUE, label.scale.equal = TRUE,
               edge.color = "#000000", threshold = similarity_threshold,
               title = title
               )
    
    
    if (is.null(file) == FALSE) {
        png(file, width = width, height = height, unit = "px")
        plot(my_graph)
        dev.off()
    }

    return(list(graph = my_graph, 
                dist = colour_distance, 
                sim = colour_similarity))
}
```

```{r}
graph_title <- "Similarity of Material 2014 colours with normal colour vision."
q_normal <- similarity_graph(mat2014$normal, file = "q_normal.png", 
                             title = graph_title)
```

q_deutan <- similarity_graph(mat2014$deutan, file = "q_deutan.png",

```

```{r}
graph_title <- "Similarity of Material 2014 colours with simulated achromatopsia."
q_achrom <- similarity_graph(mat2014$achrom, file = "q_achrom.png",
                             title = graph_title)
```

Very nice!


# Getting distances from graphs

I wonder if I can choose distant colours using their graph distance?

```{r}
graph_distance <- function(qg, cvd, colour_names) {
    dist_table <- 
        distances(as.igraph(qg)) %>% 
        as.data.frame() %>%
        set_names(colour_names) %>% 
        mutate(name = colour_names, .before = everything()) %>% 
        rowwise() %>%
        nest(distances = c(-name)) %>% 
        mutate("{{cvd}}_furthest" := 
                   map_chr(distances, 
                           function(df) {
                               df %>% 
                                   pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
                                                names_to = "name", values_to = "dist") %>% 
                                   arrange(desc(dist)) %>% 
                                   head(1) %>% 
                                   pull(name)
                           })
               ) %>% 
        select(-distances)
    
    return(dist_table)
}

furthest_normal <- graph_distance(q_normal$graph, normal, mat2014$name)
furthest_deutan <- graph_distance(q_deutan$graph, deutan, mat2014$name)
furthest_protan <- graph_distance(q_protan$graph, protan, mat2014$name)
furthest_tritan <- graph_distance(q_tritan$graph, tritan, mat2014$name)
furthest_achrom <- graph_distance(q_achrom$graph, achrom, mat2014$name)

dist_from_graph <- 
    bind_cols(
        furthest_normal,
        select(furthest_deutan, -name),
        select(furthest_protan, -name),
        select(furthest_tritan, -name),
        select(furthest_achrom, -name)
    ) %>% 
    glimpse()

sample_n(dist_from_graph, 10)
```

It's got the same shortcomings in that it keeps picking similar distant colours.


```{r}
mat2014_done <- 
    left_join(mat2014, dist_from_graph, by = "name")

show_furthest_colours <- function(df, cvd) {
    colour_names <-
        df %>%
        pull(paste0(cvd, "_furthest")) %>%
        unique()
    
    supposedly_distinct <-
        df %>%
        filter(name %in% colour_names) %>%
        pull(paste0(cvd))
    
    show_colours(supposedly_distinct)
}

show_furthest_colours(mat2014_done, "normal")
show_furthest_colours(mat2014_done, "deutan")
show_furthest_colours(mat2014_done, "protan")
show_furthest_colours(mat2014_done, "tritan")
show_furthest_colours(mat2014_done, "achrom")
```

I'm not really sure where to go from there programmatically, but I think the graphs are incredibly handy. They let me see all of the colours and how they relate to each other, and the graphs _do_ put very similar colours close together so that I don't have to think too hard about distinctiveness.
